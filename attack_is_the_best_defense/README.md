# Attack is the best defense

The objectives of this project are:

- Hacking
- Network sniffing
- ARP spoofing
- Dictionary attack
- Network and interface security
- Connecting to sendGrid's SMTP relay using telnet

## ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic

The mission is to execute this script [user_authenticating_into_server](./https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/GE_FoAUArlVccQlt7CuBGA) locally on your machine and, using `tcpdump`, sniff the network to find my password. Once you find it, paste the password in your answer file, [0-sniffing](./0-sniffing). Below is a simulation of the script.
```

#### Solution
- Open a terminal1 and run the following command `sudo tcpdump -A -i any src host <your-ip-addr>`
	- This prints outgoing packets from your device in plain text
- Open terminal2 and run the given script `./user_authenticating_into_server`
	- At the end of this script execution, analyse terminal1 to find the `[base64 encoded user password]`
- Using the linux base64 terminal command or the web application GUI, decode the base64 string to get the password.


## Dictionary attack
Password-based authentication systems can be easily broken by using a dictionary attack. Let’s try it on an SSH account.

- Install Docker on your machine Ubuntu
- Pull and run the Docker image `sylvainkalache/264-1` with the command `docker run -p 2222:22 -d -ti sylvainkalache/264-1`
- Find a password dictionary (you might need multiple of them)
- Install and use `hydra` to try to brute force the account `sylvain` via SSH on the Docker container
- Because the Docker container is running locally, hydra should access the SSH account via IP `127.0.0.1` and port `2222`
- Hint: the password is 11 characters long

#### Solution
- Password Dictionary used [rockyou.txt](./https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt)
- Command ran `hydra -l <user> -P <dictionary> ssh://127.0.0.1:2222`
